What kind of support is available for web programming in Dart?
Where can you learn more?

## Angular

Once you have worked through the
[Angular code lab](/codelabs/ng2/),
learn more from the
[Angular for Dart](https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/guide/) docs.

## JS interop

Perhaps you want to leverage one of the many existing libraries
written in JavaScript.
Use [package.js](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/js)
to implement Dart-JavaScript interoperability.
The [chartjs](https://github.com/google/chartjs.dart/)
example provides an end-to-end example of using package:js.

## Low-level HTML

Web apps are programmed in HTML and represented in the browser as
a tree structure called the DOM (Document Object Model).
Dart apps can modify the DOM programmatically, thus dynamically
changing the web page. For an introduction to programming in HTML,
check out the original
[Pirate code lab](/codelabs/darrrt). The
[tutorials](/tutorials/) have further information on
how to include a Dart script in an HTML page,
and how to add and remove elements from a web page.

## Other libraries

You're free to use whatever open-source libraries you like
when creating web apps.
For example, you can use [Polymer](/guides/polymer) elements.
