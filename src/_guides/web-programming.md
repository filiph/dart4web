What kind of support is available for web programming in Dart?
Where can you learn more?

## Angular

Once you have worked through the
[Angular code lab](/codelabs/ng2/),
learn more from the
[Angular for Dart](https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/guide/) docs.
If you are interested in using Polymer Elements in the Angular framework,
check out [Dart Academy](https://dart.academy/).

## JS Interop

Perhaps you want to leverage one of the many existing libraries
written in JavaScript.
Use [package.js](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/js)
to implement Dart-JavaScript interoperability.
The [chartjs](https://github.com/google/chartjs.dart/)
example provides an end-to-end example of using package:js.

## Polymer

For information on Polymer, see the
[Polymer Dart Developer Guide](https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer-dart/wiki).
For information on using Polymer in the Angular framework, see
[Dart Academy](https://dart.academy/).

## Low-Level HTML

Web apps are programmed in HTML and represented in the browser as
a tree structure called the DOM (Document Object Model).
Dart apps can modify the DOM programmatically, thus dynamically
changing the web page. For an introduction to programming in HTML,
check out the original
[Pirate code lab](/codelabs/darrrt). The
[Dart Tutorials](/tutorials/) have further information on
how to include a Dart script in an HTML page,
and how to add and remove elements from a web page.
