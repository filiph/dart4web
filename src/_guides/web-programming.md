What kind of support is available for web programming in Dart?
Where can you learn more?

## Angular

Work through the
[Angular 2 code lab](/codelabs/ng2/),
and then learn more from the
[Angular 2 for Dart](https://angular.io/dart) docs.

## JS interop

Perhaps you want to leverage one of the many existing libraries
written in JavaScript.
Use [package.js](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/js)
to implement Dart-JavaScript interoperability.
The [chartjs](https://github.com/google/chartjs.dart/)
example provides an end-to-end example of using package:js.

## Low-level HTML

Web apps are programmed in HTML and represented in the browser as
a tree structure called the DOM (Document Object Model).
Modifying the DOM programmatically is how web apps
dynamically change the web page.
Dart web apps can use the dart:html library to modify the DOM.

For an introduction to low-level DOM programming,
check out the original
[Pirate code lab](/codelabs/darrrt). The
[tutorials](/tutorials/) have further information on
how to include a Dart script in an HTML page,
and how to add and remove elements from a web page.
The article [Improving the DOM](/articles/low-level-html/improving-the-dom)
gives an overview of Dart's DOM API,
and how it differs from the JavaScript DOM API.

## Other libraries

You're free to use whatever open-source libraries you like
when creating web apps.
For example, you can use [Polymer](/guides/polymer) elements.
