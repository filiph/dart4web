# Pub for the Web

You can use the [pub](dartlang.org/xxx) tool to manage Dart packages and assets.
Pub also has specialized commands to support web development.
The `pub serve` command starts up a dev server.
The `pub build` command builds a deployable version of your app,
running any required transformers.
